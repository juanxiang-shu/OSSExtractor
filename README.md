# OSSExtract
Synthesis parameter extraction for on-surface synthesis literature 
Extract information from the text and identify the following information:

- Reaction type
- Precursor
- Temperature
- Substrate
- Product
- Dimension

OSSExtract uses local large language model to exreact the on-surface reaction parameter rather than the online LLM or and API. The LLM model needs to download from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-GGUF).

## Using the OSSExtract
Before strating this project, make sure the LLM model has be download from the above website.
